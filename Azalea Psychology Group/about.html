										<h2>Melanie Fox, Psy.D.: </h2>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/azalea_psychology_group_1.jpg" alt="" /></span>Dr. Melanie Fox is a licensed clinical psychologist (New York, California) providing individual and family therapy for children, adolescents, and adults. My approach to treatment is collaborative and person/family oriented. I will work with you to identify what’s most important to you etc.

											I am passionate about providing evidence-based treatment including CBT and ACT for anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and mood disorders and working with individuals moving through relationship challenges, school/job stress, and emerging adulthood issues. 
											
											I am a specialist in the treatment of eating disorders, including Anorexia Nervosa, Avoidant and Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID), and Bulimia Nervosa. Prior to working in private practice, I was the clinical director of the eating disorders program at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, New York. In this role, I developed and grew a multidisciplinary and collaborative approach to eating disorder care across inpatient and outpatient settings. I provided care for many patients and trained several pre and post-doctoral students in Family-Based Treatment (FBT), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-E (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), and CBT and SPACE principles for ARFID. In my current practice, I bring this skill set and experience, as well as extensive training in the treatment of eating disorders at Stanford School of Medicine and Children’s Hospital of Orange County, into my work with patients and families struggling with eating disorders. I also value collaborative approaches to the care of eating disorders. I am a Health at Every Size (HAES) provider.
											
											I received my doctorate in clinical psychology from the APA accredited PGSP-Stanford consortium. I completed my clinical psychology internship and postdoctoral fellowship at Children’s Hospital of Orange County (CHOC). Prior to internship, I trained at specialized autism, psychodiagnostic testing, anxiety, eating disorders, and early psychosis clinics at the Stanford School of Medicine and University of San Francisco. 
											</p>
											<h2>Liza Pincus, Psy.D.:  </h2>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/azalea_psychology_group_3.jpg" alt="" /></span>Dr. Liza Pincus is a licensed clinical psychologist (New York, New Jersey, PSYPACT) and DBT-Linehan Board of Certification, Certified Clinician™, with expertise in the delivery of evidence-based treatments including Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). I treat emotion regulation difficulties and post-traumatic stress, obsessive-compulsive, sleep, anxiety, mood, and personality disorders for clients ages 13 and above. 

											Before transitioning into private practice, I served as the clinical director of the Adolescent DBT Program at the Montefiore Medical Center Moses Child Outpatient Psychiatry Division, a fully adherent DBT program serving teens and families in the Bronx, and the clinic where DBT was originally adapted for adolescents. In my roles as clinical director and Assistant Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, I directed the annual intensive foundational training in DBT for all psychology and psychiatry trainees, and frequently taught and supervised graduate students. 
											
											I trained under the mentorship of Dr. Shireen Rivzi, an international expert in DBT research and training and a student of Dr. Marsha Linehan, the creator of DBT. I am also intensively trained in Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy for PTSD, the combined DBT-PE protocol, Radically-Open DBT (RO-DBT), and have worked at clinics specializing in DBT, anxiety, OCD, PTSD, and health psychology. 
											
											I have published several peer-reviewed journal articles on the dissemination and implementation of Prolonged Exposure for PTSD in community health clinics, through the Center for the Study and Treatment of Anxiety at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, under the direction of Dr. Edna Foa. I have also published book chapters and presented at professional conferences. I am an active member of the International Society for the Implementation and Teaching of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (ISITDBT) and the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies (ABCT).
